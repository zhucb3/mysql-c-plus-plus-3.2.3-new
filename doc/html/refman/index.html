Getting Started</h1>
<p>The best place to get started is the <a href="../userman/index.html">user manual</a>. It provides a guide to the example programs and more.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="classes"></a>
Major Classes</h1>
<p>In MySQL++, the main user-facing classes are <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1Connection.html" title="Manages the connection to the database server. ">mysqlpp::Connection</a>, <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1Query.html" title="A class for building and executing SQL queries. ">mysqlpp::Query</a>, <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1Row.html" title="Manages rows from a result set. ">mysqlpp::Row</a>, <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1StoreQueryResult.html" title="StoreQueryResult set type for &quot;store&quot; queries. ">mysqlpp::StoreQueryResult</a>, and <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1UseQueryResult.html" title="StoreQueryResult set type for &quot;use&quot; queries. ">mysqlpp::UseQueryResult</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, MySQL++ has a mechanism called Specialized SQL Structures (SSQLS), which allow you to create C++ structures that parallel the definition of the tables in your database schema. These let you manipulate the data in your database using native C++ data structures. Programs using this feature often include very little SQL code, because MySQL++ can generate most of what you need automatically when using SSQLSes. There is a whole chapter in the user manual on how to use this feature of the library, plus a section in the user manual's tutorial chapter to introduce it. It's possible to use MySQL++ effectively without using SSQLS, but it sure makes some things a lot easier.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="files"></a>
Major Files</h1>
<p>The only two header files your program ever needs to include are mysql++.h, and optionally custom.h. (The latter implements the SSQLS mechanism.) All of the other files are used within the library only.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_questions"></a>
If You Have Questions...</h1>
<p>If you want to email someone to ask questions about this library, we greatly prefer that you send mail to the MySQL++ mailing list, which you can subscribe to here: <a href="http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus">http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus</a></p>
<p>That mailing list is archived, so if you have questions, do a search to see if the question has been asked before.</p>
<p>You may find people's individual email addresses in various files within the MySQL++ distribution. Please do not send mail to them unless you are sending something that is inherently personal. Questions that are about MySQL++ usage may well be ignored if you send them to our personal email accounts. Those of us still active in MySQL++ development monitor the mailing list, so you aren't getting any extra "coverage" by sending messages to those addresses in addition to the mailing list.</p>
